# BAC23
Bachelor's thesis repository

This repository contains the files necessary for recreating the simulations performed in the bachelor's thesis. The Latex-file associated with the document as well as figures and other items can also be found here.

## Running the simulations
In order to run the simulations, an Openlab account is needed. This can be created on live.openlive.app. 
Before simulations can start, a configuration is needed. This configuration represents the well and formation to be used in the simulations. Elements such as length of the well, drilling fluid used, and the possibility of incidents can be adjusted, in adition to much more. The specific settings used for the simulations in the thesis can be viewed in part B of the Appendix in the thesis.

In order to run simulations through Python, the program must be installed on the computer, a configuration must be set up, and a valid user account created.
